# ReactJS-Todo
My copy of https://github.com/bigbinary/learn-reactjs-in-steps with (hopefully) some additions.

To Run Locally:
1. install Recent version of node & npm
    -- node -v should return something like : v4.4.0
    -- npm -v should return something like : 2.14.20

2. Then clone this repository (need to install Git ofcourse).
    -- something like: git clone https://github.com/comdotlinux/ReactJS-Todo.git

3. cd to the ReactJS-Todo directory
4. Run npm install
5. If you see no errors (internet connection required)
6. in the same directory run npm start
    -- If you see something like:: index.html rendered. AND :: webpack: bundle is now VALID.
7. Point your browser to localhost:8080 and enjoy

If it is running you could access the app directly at : https://reactjs-todo-comdotlinux.c9users.io/

I am mostly running out of ideas to improve user experience. Jence any suggestions are welcome.
